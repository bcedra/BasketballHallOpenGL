## Description 
This application is implemented using OpenGL. Open Graphics Library is a programming language for graphical components. For creating the objects I used 3ds Max and for textures I used Photoshop CS6. The hall has many places for viewers and 4 access doors and outside the hall, as a backdrop of the scenario, I have a winter theme skybox added to OpenGL. The basketball hall has a parallelepiped shape with textures applied.
