## Description 
This application is implemented this using OpenGL. Open Graphics Library is a programming language for graphical components. And for creating the objects I used 3ds Max. Also for textures I used Photoshop CS6. The hall has many places for viewers and 4 access doors. And outside the hall, as a backdrop of the scenario, I have a winter theme skybox added to OpenGL. Outside, the basketball court has a parallelepiped shape with textures applied.
